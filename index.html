            <p>
                I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Stanford with a concentration in ML and natural language processing, translating research into human-centered products. I'm exploring large-scale genomic sequence models for biology and reimagining the learning process with an AI-first approach.
            </p>

            <p>
                I currently lead a team at the Neural Interaction Lab (Stanford Bioengineering), building multimodal LLMs for physiological data (ECG & EEG), under the supervision of Prof. Todd Coleman. We received the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI's grant "Learning through Creation with Generative AI" where I was named co-principal investigator for the project.

    <p>
                Previously, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at Superfluid Dx. (an Alzheimer's diagnostics company founded by Steve Quake, Lee Otterson Professor at Stanford University and former co-President of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, widely recognized as a serial innovator for his pioneering contributions to microfluidics, genomics, and non-invasive medical diagnostics) and led the company's effort to benchmark and leverage large foundational models to optimize cell-free RNA signals. Prior to that, I conducted research at the Stanford NLP lab under the supervision of Prof. Diyi Yang on evaluating and finetuning LLMs for multi-turn educational interactions in multicultural environments.
            </p>

            <p>
                I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science at Stanford University and studied at the British International School in Phuket, Thailand where I grew up.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and reading science fiction novels. Whenever I go back to Thailand, I mentor K-12 students in engineering/design projects in my free time and have done similar work volunteering at a Montessori School in Slovenia (Summer 2019).
            </p>

            <p>
                My main interests are in applications of artificial intelligence for education and biology. Please see my publications and reports section on my resume for academic work.
